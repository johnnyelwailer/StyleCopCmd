    NOTE 1
    make sure to include the default namespace so that visual studio
    will turn on intellisense for this nant build file 
    
    NOTE 2
    for non .NET developers: for all intents and purpose a solution in 
    VisualStudio (VS) is the same thing as a top-level project in most other
    languages, and VS project is the same as a package. in order to make it 
    easier for communicate amonst .NET developers working with both VS and
    NAnt, this NAnt build file will refer to the top-level project as a solution
    and packages as projects.
